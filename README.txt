This week is nothing to complex. I was more refamiliarzing myself with a lot of tools.
For my web based technology I decided to use two.js. 
It was a bit tricky to get the hang of and I'm still learning how it exactly works. I'm sure my code could be more optimized.
But I'm pretty happy with what I cam up with for learning a new coding language.
I also used vs code for this assignment. It was a good refresher on what components are needed for a webpage.
I also made some svg's in Adobe Illustrator for the assignemnt. I haven't used Illustrator in a while so that was also a nice refresher.
For those I mostly used the line tool while tracing over images. Trying to get a clean minimalist look.

The project itself is some different Pikachu svg's moving across the screen. Just a simple animation. The background also fades.
I did find that whenever a new object starts moving across there is a small second where its at position 0, 0.
I think this is due to me not fully understanding two.js yet.

I may experiment more in the future, I feel like I really only cracked the surface of what's possible.
